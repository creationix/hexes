# Hexes

This is a simple game that uses a luvit server to sync up piece movements between all players.

Before you can run this, you need some dependencies installed.

Once the code is checked out, run this from the root of the code tree and lit will grab all the dependencies automatically.

    lit install

To start the server simply type the following in this folder:

    luvit server.lua

Then go to http://localhost:8080/ in a modern browser to see the game served from your local laptop.

To play, simply click (or tap) on a piece, and then click where you want it to go.  Open the same url in a couple browser windows to see them stay synced.
